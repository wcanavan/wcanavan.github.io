        Will Canavan - Young Professional Labor Ready for Hire
        </h2>

        <div>
            <p id="maintext"> Will Canavan is a sophomore attending Occidental College, and is currently available for Summer 2019 Internship positions
            (paid and unpaid) as well as fellowship, research, or otherwise career-building opportunities. Based in the Washington, D.C. metro
            area, Will is majoring in Diplomacy & World Affairs, with prospective minor degrees in Economics and/or Computer Science. In line with his impressive
            academic record and commendable work ethic, Will participates in a number of non-academic extracirriculars and is a Programming Assistant at the office of Student Life.
            A friendly and energetic presence, he looks forward to one day being employed outside of Occidental College and the financial independence from paying back his parent's
            for helping him take a few loans to attend college. Please hire him, because this one is a real pragmatist; he will really take what he can get. </p>
